To Test:
Ensure your Cargo.toml is correct (as per the previous correction with serde and serde_json).

Save the combined src/main.rs file.

Run the application:

Bash

cargo run
You will see output indicating both endpoints are available.

Test the VULNERABLE endpoint:

Command Injection:
Bash

curl http://127.0.0.1:8080/vulnerable_info_check?c=id
Arbitrary File Read:
Bash

curl http://127.0.0.1:8080/vulnerable_info_check?f=/etc/passwd
Test the MITIGATED endpoint:

Secure Access:
Bash

curl http://127.0.0.1:8080/mitigated_info_check
Attempting old vulnerable calls (will fail with 404 or an error):
Bash

curl http://127.0.0.1:8080/mitigated_info_check?c=id
curl http://127.0.0.1:8080/mitigated_info_check?f=/etc/passwd
These attempts will still hit the mitigated_isp_info_check function, but since it doesn't process c or f parameters, they will simply be ignored, and you'll get the standard, safe JSON output.
This setup provides a very effective way to demonstrate the "before and after" of applying security mitigations!
